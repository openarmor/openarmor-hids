# You need to create a set and a rule that uses it in order for packets to be dropped
# make sure the drop rules are checked before the accept rules
# Example:
# nft add set inet filter openarmor_ar4 { type ipv4_addr\; comment \"openarmor active response\" \; }
# nft add set inet filter openarmor_ar6 { type ipv6_addr\; comment \"openarmor active response\" \; }
# nft add rule inet filter input ip saddr @openarmor_ar4 drop
# nft add rule inet filter input ip6 saddr @openarmor_ar6 drop
