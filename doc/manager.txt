How do the server manager the agents.

-The server will open port 1514 (by default) and listen for
 messages from the clients. Only the IP of the clients will be
 allowed.

-Every 10 minutes, the client will send an status notification
 to the server. This status message contain some information
 about the agent system and information about the files it
 has on the shared directory.
 
-The server will receive the status message, update the agent
 status file and check if it has any file to be sent to the 
 agent. If it has, it will connect to the agent and send
 the file.

-Every message will be encrypted.
